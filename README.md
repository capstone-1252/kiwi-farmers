## Work Flow

These steps are to be followed whenever you intend to contribute this GitHub repository;

    1. Before starting, always remember to pull the repository to keep your files up to date.
        - Clone or Pull the repo into the themes folder in your Wordpress installation

    2. Preform the work you intend to do

    3. When you would wish to commit to the repository, inform your teammates of your intention to
    commit.
        - If a teammate has committed something to the repository during the duration of you working, 
        remember to Pull the repository again to ensure there are no merge conflicts
    
    4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for as long as you intend to work

These steps are to be followed to help prevent any issues that may arise from merge conflicts. There is no worse feeling in the world that working hard on something just for it to go to waste, so to reduce and prevent this possibility for happening

**Work flow may be subject to change to fit the needs of the project**

Hey... it's been a while, huh?

Yeah, so development on the site has basically completely halted due to not having a finalized design. It'd be quite a waste of time to be working on a design we don't have finalized, and would need to go back and redo repeatedly. As a result, in case the severe lack of updates to the repository isn't obvious, we haven't made any additions to the theme.

However, don't let the lack of development lead you to believe we have been doing nothing (aside for during reading week, naturally). Rodney has been putting his nose to the grindstone working on the final design, while I have been busy researching and preparing content to eventually fill out the website as soon as the design is ready to be implemented.

Thus far, I have researched and written about every service our client provides, and have written a biography about the client. I sent the first draft of the biography to the client for feedback and approval earlier today, and I intend to spend time recompiling the services research into a slightly more interesting block of text, to steer away from what is currently an uninteresting block of text.

Development will resume eventually, and I hope as soon as I am given the green light, I can rapidly implement everything I have been writing over the past 2-3 weeks.

We have recently completed some more user testing of our low fidelity wire frame. We're compiling our notes into a spreadsheet, and we are pleased with the feedback we have received. With this information, Rodney will further refine the high fidelity design into something we will deliver to the client for feedback and approval. In the mean time, I will be working on the WordPress installation, doing things like adding pages and posts to fit the requirements of the site, as well as test navigation between these pages and posts.

We also replaced screenshot.png with a more appropriate image of the logo of Top Asian Massage. No more crusty land shark ;-;

It was decided that instead of making a Classic theme, we will be making a Block theme with Full Site Editing. This will significantly benefit development as we have much more familiarity using Block themes as opposed to Classic themes. With this change, we intend to speed up development by specializing in areas of WordPress we have stronger knowledge, hopefully cutting down on the amount of time wasted on fist fighting with a Classic theme when a Block theme will work with little fuss. These changes will be pushed by the end of this work period.

screenshot.png is a placeholder image used for the skeleton structure of the classic theme. This image is to be replaced with a more appropriate image later in production.

## Work Flow

These steps are to be followed whenever you intend to contribute this GitHub repository;

    1. Before starting, always remember to pull the repository to keep your files up to date.
        - Clone or Pull the repo into the themes folder in your Wordpress installation

    2. Preform the work you intend to do

    3. When you would wish to commit to the repository, inform your teammates of your intention to
    commit.
        - If a teammate has committed something to the repository during the duration of you working, 
        remember to Pull the repository again to ensure there are no merge conflicts
    
    4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for as long as you intend to work

These steps are to be followed to help prevent any issues that may arise from merge conflicts. There is no worse feeling in the world that working hard on something just for it to go to waste, so to reduce and prevent this possibility for happening

**Work flow may be subject to change to fit the needs of the project**
